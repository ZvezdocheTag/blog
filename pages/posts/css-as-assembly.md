# CSS as Assembly Language

- Today, understanding CSS is essential to building Web interfaces
- CSS is hard
- CSS appears simple
- Wearing CSS mastery as a badge
  - Exclusivity
  - Be humble
  - Reality
- Software abstractions
  - We need better abstractions
- Treat CSS as assembly language
  - Useful on occasion
  - You shouldn't have to thinking about it very often
  - Computers are better suited to handle this stuff
- What are the right abstractions?
- My humble attempts
