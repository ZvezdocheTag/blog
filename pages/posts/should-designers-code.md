# Should Designers Code

- We're asking the wrong question
- Should anyone code?
- Should we teach our children Math?
- Should we teach our children how to read and write?
- Code literacy
- Software as abstractions
  - Punch cards
  - Assembly language
  - Higher-level languages
  - C
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - Components
- Code is the interface between humans and computers
- If computers are the bicycle of the mind, code is how you ride the bike
- research: pen > pencil > typewriter > word processor + thinking reference
