# Jxnblk Uses

A list of hardware, software, and other things I use.

*Updated July 2019*

## Hardware

### MacBook Air

This is my primary work computer at the moment, but is larger and heavier than I'd like.
The sloped keyboard feels more comfortable than the MacBook Pro's and is the main factor I took into consideration when purchasing.
That said, the Apple butterfly keyboard is garbage.
I've had the keyboard replaced under the replacement program once already, about one month after purchase,

but the new keyboard still sticks and missed keypresses regularly.
The iPad Pro smart keyboard case is infinitely better than the current MacBook keyboards.

### MacBook 12"

I still have my old MacBook 12" (recently discontinued) because it is a much nicer size to travel with and use as a "laptop" in the truest sense.
**I would buy a smaller and lighter laptop if a decent option existed.**
This is the second model I've owned, and I've gone through two keyboards on each one.
The keyboard feels great when it's brand new, but quickly becomes a squishy disappointing mess after a month or so, especially with the New York summer humidity.

For average web dev tasks, I don't have any issues with its speed, but I don't use heavy audio, video, or photo editing applications very often.

Despite the garbage keyboard, the 12" MacBook is still my favorite computer I've ever owned, but I hope to find something that surpasses it in the future.

### iPad Pro 11"

I'm very intrigued by the idea of portable and mobile computing and pushing what's possible with today's technology.
The iPad Pro is easily the best iPad ever, but it's still a crippled machine compared to a laptop.
The lack of a built-in terminal and development environment makes this an impossible machine to use professionally,
but it's still an interesting device, and is very nice to use as a reading and writing device.

I occasionally connect my Raspberry Pi 4 via SSH to do more with the iPad, and I've written this page with that setup.

In the future, I imagine I'd be happy using a smartphone, a wireless keyboard, and a pair of AR googles to do what I currently do on laptops today.

### iPhone XS Max

This is the biggest phone I've ever owned. I kinda like it, but I'm thinking I'll switch back to the normal sized iPhone the next time around.

#### Apps

I really, *really* hate 99% of third-party iOS apps.
Monument Valley is great!
I use iMessages, Notes, and Safari more than anything else.
I have the NYC Ferry app installed for tickets.
I use Google Maps because Apple Maps does not understand search and doesn't have reviews and photos of restaurants.
Google Maps also lists train delays, which is helpful.
For work, I have Slack, which works but I find it very confusing to use.
I still use the Twitter app, but I also use mobile.twitter.com quite a bit.
I also have some bank apps, but they are bank apps.

When I look at most of the apps I have installed on my phone, I can't help but think all these things should be built into the OS itself.

## Software

### Vim

Vim is like playing the piano.
You can learn to play *When the Saints go Marching In* or you can learn to compose music like Chopin.
It takes time and practice to learn, but it's incredibly rewarding and productive.

Despite all the IDEs and text editors that have come out in the past three decades, nothing holds a candle to Vim.
Vim "mode" in another text editor is NOT Vim.
Vim turns your Bash shell into a Unix-based IDE, and its extensibility and modal text editing capabilities are unmatched by anything else.

If you don't use Vim, this sounds like every other fanboy comment,
but I really think that as a software developer,
learning to use Vim is the most valuable thing I've ever done.

### Chrome

I used to use Safari for everything, but it's so far behind Chrome at this point that I just gave up.
