- healthy fear of rewrites
- healthy fear of refactoring
- sometimes rewrites are more efficient than refactoring
- "dont hold on to darlings"
- modularity
- open source
  - trends in issues and bugs
  - feature requests
- reevaluate initial assumptions
- all code is biased
- don't tell your manager
  - managers do not understand refactoring or rewrites
- timeboxing
- don't waste time if it's not worth it
